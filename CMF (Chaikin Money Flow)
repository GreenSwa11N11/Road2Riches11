CMF stands for Chaikin Money Flow, a volume-weighted indicator created by Marc Chaikin that measures buying and selling pressure over a specific period (typically 21 days).
What It Measures
CMF combines price and volume data to determine whether money is flowing into or out of a security. It's based on the idea that rising prices with strong volume indicate accumulation (buying pressure), while falling prices with strong volume indicate distribution (selling pressure).
How It Works
The calculation involves:

Money Flow Multiplier: Determines where the closing price is relative to the high-low range for the period
Money Flow Volume: Multiplies the multiplier by volume
CMF: Sums the money flow volume over the period and divides by total volume

Interpretation

CMF above 0: Indicates buying pressure (accumulation) - bullish signal
CMF below 0: Indicates selling pressure (distribution) - bearish signal
Extreme values (+0.25 or higher, -0.25 or lower): Suggest strong buying or selling pressure
Divergences: When CMF moves opposite to price, it can signal potential reversals

Example Usage
If a stock is rising but CMF is declining or negative, it suggests the rally lacks volume support and may be weakening. Conversely, if a stock is falling but CMF is rising, it might indicate accumulation during the decline.
Traders often use CMF alongside other indicators like moving averages or RSI to confirm trends and identify potential entry/exit points.
